# A Celebration of Coffee

We drink so much of the stuff working on these sites we thought we'd celebrate.

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:ajsl/coffee_page.git
cd website
npm install
```

### Dependencies

The website relies on the following: 

```
gulp
gulp-clean-css
gulp-concat
gulp-eslint
gulp-jscs
gulp-rename
gulp-sass
gulp-sequence
gulp-uglify-es
gulp-watch
```

### And coding style tests

The default style is 4 spaces. So `gulp watch` will warning if JavaScript doesn't look like this:

```
if (a) {
    b=c;
    function foo(d) {
        e=f;
    }
}
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
